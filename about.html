				Ayurvedic Dinacharya Explained</a>
			<p>
				
				Dinacharya, is a Sanskrit word made up of ‘Dina’, meaning day and ‘Acharya’, meaning activity/behaviour. This is designed to maintain and connect us with our circadian rhythm or internal body clocks. In Ayurveda, the importance of consistent daily routine cannot be underestimated. It sets the tone for our entire day, bringing a sense of calm and well-being. It gives the body, mind, and spirit the chance to ground and cleanse. Dinacharya makes us understand the best time for our daily routines such as waking, exercise, bathing, meditation, prayers, meals, study, work, relaxation, and sound sleeping.<br>
				
				Ayurveda’s emphasis on connecting ourselves with nature has existed since millennia, however the western scientists are now beginning to understand the importance of our body to stay connected with the rhythm of nature. Disconnection from this circadian rhythm is known as chronodisruption, which leads to a host of health concerns, including poor cognitive function, mood and sleep disorders, daytime sleepiness, reduced school & work performances. substance abuse, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and some cancers. A significant disturbance of the circadian disturbance of physiology, metabolism and behaviour can be caused by factors related to diet and activities, including stress, technology overexposure, but in turn also leads to disturbances in metabolic activity potentially generating a negative vicious cycle.<br>
				
				Ayurveda tells us that on any given day, there are two cycles of change that exists- the Sun cycle and the Moon cycle- and they are connected with the ayurvedic body type, or doshic constitution ( Vata, Pitta, and Kapha).<br>
				Dinacharya makes us understand the best time for our daily routine/ activities and thus maintaining our doshas (our functional energies) in perfect balance, maintain appropriate digestive fire, inculcates discipline, promoting peace, happiness and longevity.
